# SolarInstallationOptimizationinColorado
We split the Colorado state into 8 areas depending on the geographical features, population, avg elevation and climate. Built a Linear Programming Model over OpenPV Project data managed by National Renewable Energy Lab(NREL) using CPLEX and GUROBI solvers in AMPL code to get optimized costs. Concluded that CO state would need 48.7 sq. miles of additional solar panels over 0.32 sq. miles of solar panels already installed to meet our current energy needs.
